<p>Attention is a resource - and everyone is limited.ï¼ˆMatthew Crawfordï¼‰.
      The core resources of the information society are attention, attention is limited and scarce, and the competition for attention has promoted the development of society. The Internet is a place for attention trading. for exampleï¼Œthe Internet ecosystem , if a website has more and more users, it gets more and more attention, and it is more important for users, then people will put more attention to improve it. Conversely, if a site has a small user base, it gets less attention and develops more slowly, or diminishing with less attention.Figure 1 is an Internet Attention Ecosystem. Google search engine is at the center of the Internet. The bigger the point, the more attention the site gets.</p>

<p>Community stickness, a measure of how much attention your site gets, more intuitively, says it calculates the average number of hits per person on that site. Figure 2 shows the daily number of users and the number of user clicks of the psychology course (autonomous mode)<br />

<p>Figure 3 shows the psychology course stickness index, the slope of the fitted line is stickness.
The psychology course has a slope of 1.09.</p>

<p>Predicting community development ï¼ŒWe want to predict the success of a given communityï¼›
Calculate the stickiness of the forum for each course and evaluate the quality of the course ï¼›
Taking the course of the introduction of psychology as an example, the attention flow network is established by using nodes of different levelsï¼›
Based on the learnerâ€™s attention flow data, the attention flow network of different course neutron nodes is compared laterally ï¼›
Clustering students to analyze Whether the learning trajectory of learners Curriculum stickiness ,and its structure (network diameter, cluster coefficient) affect the collective attention flow changes;
Mining Course Structures: How does the tree structure affect attention flow?
