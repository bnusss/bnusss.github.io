<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>There are enormous complexity in the socia-economics system, not only because of the huge interaction elements in the system, but also because of the human participation, the expectation, the incomplete information, the group and so on, which make the system understandability and predictability great challenge. This part of the study includes the modelling of the city, the scale distribution of the enterprise, the formation of the price in the auction, the naming process, the law in the Chinese language, the international trade, the migration of the population, the behavior of the scientists and so on.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>By 2014, half of humanity has moved to cities, and the process of urbanization will grow even faster. By 2050, it is said, humanity will be 70% urbanized. Therefore, it is very important to study the form, growth and evolution of the city.</p>

<p>One of the research our groups focused on was the modeling of cities and the use of big data analysis to study cities.</p>

<div id="pos212"></div>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>One of the great fascinations of complexity research is that there may be a very simple rule behind the complex appearance. For a system as complex as the city, the complexity research in recent years has revealed the laws of ZIPF, Gibrat, and the law of heterospeed growth, etc. There are even a wide variety of quantitative models that can explain the shape and growth of cities.</p>

<p>Based on the previous research, we proposed our own growth model of cities. The model is based on the very simple assumption that human beings need to be connected to each other once they enter the city and settle down, so that people can easily share resources. Beyond that, we can create a model of urban growth for urban roads and for people to make simple rules for their socio economic interactions. The model can not only explain the various growth laws observed for a long time, but also give the shape of population, road and GDP in space quantitatively, and coincide with the empirical data. For more details about this model, see: <a href="http://wiki.swarma.net/index.php/%E5%8C%B9%E9%85%8D%E7%94%9F%E9%95%BF%E9%9A%8F%E6%9C%BA%E5%87%A0%E4%BD%95%E5%9B%BE%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B">matching the growth random geometry model.</a></p>

<div id="pos221"></div>
<h3 id="background-1">Background</h3>

<p>Auctions, which represent a typical human economic behavior, have a long history: records indicate that auctions were held as early as 500 B.C., and they have evolved into various kinds of new auctions. Recently, a new type of auction, the lowest unique bid auction (LUBA), has been gaining in popularity throughout the world. Unlike traditional types of auctions such as English or Dutch auctions, this type of reverse auction allows the winner to gain an expensive object at an extremely low cost. In addition to generating enthusiasm, the bid-distribution characteristics and mechanism have attracted the attention of many researchers. Meanwhile, the lowest unique positive integer game (LUPI) and related studies have also garnered considerable interest [5,6]. In fact, the stable distributions of both LUBA and LUPI are the same, with higher bid probabilities at lower prices and lower probabilities at higher prices. However, it is clear that players in LUBA and LUPI are faced with the same strategic conflict in attempting to choose bids that are both low and unique</p>

<p>To explain the formation of this distribution, several models have been proposed. Rapoport, Otsubo, Kim &amp; Stein have constructed symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium solutions and then tested them in a series of experiments in which the number of bidders and the size of the strategy space were varied. Houba, van der Laan &amp; Veldhuizen have concluded that the symmetric NE (Nash equilibrium) with the lowest expected gains is the maximin in a symmetric strategy; this criterion allows for computation using a mathematical program. Pigolotti, Bernhardsson, Juul, Galster &amp; Vivo have used a grand canonical approach to derive an analytical expression for the equilibrium distribution of strategies. They then studied the properties of the solution as a function of the mean number of players and compared their results against a large data set of internet auctions. Very recently, Zhao, Chen &amp; Wang [8] have developed a model in which it is assumed that agents prefer to bid on the price at which the probability of winning is highest. However, almost all such studies have been based on the symmetric Nash equilibrium.</p>

<h3 id="method-1">Method</h3>

<p>We presents the LUBA bid distribution and proposes an optimization model based on non-perfect information. The kernel of this model is the premise that each agent performs the same optimization based on some imaginary information or assumptions regarding the behavior of the others. The model fits real LUBA distributions very well, and this paradigm seems to be more acceptable and reliable than that based on the symmetric Nash equilibrium.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Research concerning various types of auctions is a topic of considerable interest in various interdisciplinary fields of science. The nature of the bid distribution of LUBA and its emergence from individual psychology and behavior has aroused the interest of many experts. In this paper, in a departure from the symmetric Nash equilibrium framework, we construct a new model based on assumed information regarding the behavior of others using the Poisson distribution and an exponential distribution. This model fits the empirical data better than do models based on the symmetric Nash equilibrium because it can reproduce both the overall decreasing trend and the localized increase at lower bid prices in most cases. Furthermore, we present the effects of parameters Î», Î± and Î½ on the shape of the bid distribution. The impact of these three parameters on the distribution is very complex. For appropriate values of Î», Î± and</p>
