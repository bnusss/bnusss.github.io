<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I am a second year graduate student  inÂ Systems ScienceÂ at the Beijing Normal University and my tutor isÂ Jake. I received my Bachelor of Information Managerment and Indormation System from the Communication University of China in 2016.</p>

<p>I am broadly interested in Geometric deep learning, Machine learning, Computer Vision and Data Mining. I am working on the research of learning graph-structure data now. Please see details of my projects experience below.</p>

<p>Artificial intellengence will change our world greatly.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<p>2017.10 - At present Â Â Dynamic Process Learning on NetworkÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Project Leader
Used deep learning algorithm Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to study the propagation dynamics on Â network, and to predict node states, such as traffic volume prediction on traffic network.</p>

<p>1.Studied the principles of GCN and reproduced the model with pytorch.</p>

<p>2.For the dynamic process problem on network, we analyzed the feasibility and improvement measures of GCN.</p>

<p>3.Made experiments of node state prediction on networks.</p>

<p>4.Processed London traffic network data and conducted traffic volume prediction experiments with improved GCN.</p>

<p>2016.09 â€“ 2018.02 Â Â Complex Networks ClassificationÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Project Leader
Proposed complex network classification model CNC combining DeepWalk and CNN.</p>

<p>1.Studied the principles of deep learning model CNN and graph embedding model DeepWalk.</p>

<p>2.Considered the feasibility and measures of combining the two models to complete the complex network classification task and then proposed our mode CNC.</p>

<p>3.Set up classification experiments to validate our model, such as classifying small-world and scale-free networks, international trade networks classification, etc.</p>

<p>4.Wrote the paper and submitted it to journal.</p>

<h2 id="internship-experience">Internship Experience</h2>

<p>2016.04 â€“ 2016.08 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GuangHeXinZhi (Beijing) Technology Co. Ltd. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Data Mining Intern</p>

<p>1.Completed data requirements from product managers. Analyzed and visualized data, submitted data reports.</p>

<p>2.Completed the data visualization project independently. Used ECharts to visualize geographical distribution of users across the country.</p>

<p>3.Participated in the data processing part of adaptive algorithm development. The algorithm was using machine learning algorithm to recommend personalized courses for different users.</p>
