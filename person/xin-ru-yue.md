## About Me

I am a second year graduate student  in Systems Science at the Beijing Normal University and my tutor is Jake. I received my Bachelor of Information Managerment and Indormation System from the Communication University of China in 2016. 

I am broadly interested in Geometric deep learning, Machine learning, Computer Vision and Data Mining. I am working on the research of learning graph-structure data now. Please see details of my projects experience below.

Artificial intellengence will change our world greatly. 


## Experience

2017.10 - At present   Dynamic Process Learning on Network           Project Leader
Used deep learning algorithm Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to study the propagation dynamics on  network, and to predict node states, such as traffic volume prediction on traffic network. 

1.Studied the principles of GCN and reproduced the model with pytorch.

2.For the dynamic process problem on network, we analyzed the feasibility and improvement measures of GCN.

3.Made experiments of node state prediction on networks.

4.Processed London traffic network data and conducted traffic volume prediction experiments with improved GCN.


2016.09 – 2018.02   Complex Networks Classification             Project Leader
Proposed complex network classification model CNC combining DeepWalk and CNN. 

1.Studied the principles of deep learning model CNN and graph embedding model DeepWalk.

2.Considered the feasibility and measures of combining the two models to complete the complex network classification task and then proposed our mode CNC.

3.Set up classification experiments to validate our model, such as classifying small-world and scale-free networks, international trade networks classification, etc.

4.Wrote the paper and submitted it to journal.

## Internship Experience

2016.04 – 2016.08         GuangHeXinZhi (Beijing) Technology Co. Ltd.                 Data Mining Intern

1.Completed data requirements from product managers. Analyzed and visualized data, submitted data reports.

2.Completed the data visualization project independently. Used ECharts to visualize geographical distribution of users across the country.

3.Participated in the data processing part of adaptive algorithm development. The algorithm was using machine learning algorithm to recommend personalized courses for different users.

## Skills

English: Excellent reading and writing ability, read and write English papers fluently. Good at listening and speaking.

Computer skills: Good at using the python language. Familiar with deep learning algorithms such as CNN, GCN, etc. 

Familiar with pytorch, tensorflow, caffe and other deep learning frameworks. Good at operating linux system, familiar with github. Used R language, spss for data analysis; used Java to complete small projects.

## Visiting experience

2017/08 University of Oxford 
Attended lectures and English learning lessons and experienced British traditional culture. 

2018/01 Arizona State University
Attended Pro Sander and Pro Lai’s classes about system science, data science, complex network, etc. Attended group meting and made a presentation.
