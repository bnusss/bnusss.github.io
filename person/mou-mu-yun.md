## Experience

I graduated from dalian maritime university with a bachelor's degree in intelligent science and technology.During my undergraduate years, I was keen on participating in competitions.I have won many awards such as Huawei software elite challenge(top 32), ACM(bronze medal), MCMICM(Meritorious Winner) and so on, and got an offer from Huawei. But out of the pursuit of knowledge and freedom, I realized that these are not what I want, so I came to the school of system science of Beijing normal university.
