## The Hidden Flow Structure and Metric Space under Random Walk based Network Embedding Algorithms


Network embedding which encodes all vertices in a network as a set of numerical vectors in accordance with the networks’ local and global structures. Recently, several algorithms based on random walks such as deepwalk and node2vec have drawn much attention for their high efficiency and accuracy in node classification however there is still a lack of theoretical explanation, and the transparency of those algorithms has been doubted. Here, we propose FGE algorithm to uncover the underlying flow structure and its hidden metric space of the random walk based embedding algorithms. We show that the essence of embedding is the latent metric structure defined on the open-flow network. This discovery not only deepens our understanding of random walk based embedding algorithms but also helps in finding new potential applications in network embedding.

To build a connection between language and network, a random walk needs to be implemented on the network such that the node sequences generated by random walks are treated as sentences in which nodes resemble words. To reveal the flow structure behind a random walk strategy, we construct an open-flow network model in accordance with the random walk strategies. An open-flow network is a special directed weighted network in which the nodes are identical to those of the original network, and the weighted edges represent the actual fluxes realized by a large number of random walks. Figure 1 illustrates how the different open-flow networks are constructed for a single background binary network with deepwalk in the upper panel and node2vec in the lower panel.The combination of flow distance and the manifold learning method Multi-Dimensional Scaling is named as Flow-based Geometric Embedding (FGE).

1. We notice that the open flow network model can be used to reflect the flow structure behind different random walk strategies. As shown in table 1
2. We discover that there is a high correlation between the flow distance and the euclidean distance calculated by the embedding results of node2vec algorithm for any node pair, therefore, the embedding results of FGE and node2vec are highly correlated compared to other known embedding algorithms. As shown in table 2
3. We infer that there is a hidden metric structure in the embedding vector space, and this metric structure can be used for clustering and ranking nodes. As shown in Figure 2

# Input Output Network


## Background
The main content of input-output analysis is comprehending the technical and economic relationship between the sectors and quantitatively describing it is is an emphatic issue in the region economy research. However, few studies put effort into extracting the macro-level characteristics from the microscopic connections between these sectors and quantitatively comparing two economies from their structures.

## Purpose
We propose a network-based approach to treat industrial system as an open flow network where source and sink node are considered as environment to depict the influence of final demand and value-added. This new framework allows us to define a new distance(flow distance) by which we can capture information of directly consumed relationship and topological structure. Empirically, we demonstrate and compare the industrial structures of China and the United States, noticing some industries possess totally different ecological niches in different countries. Further, temporal data of flow distances can simulate the evolution of an industry, where our model deductions is proved by empirical evidences.

## Method
We convert the input-output table to an open flow network, called industry flow network(IFN). There are two types of nodes in IFN: one type is the industry node, where a node is an independent sector; the other is the source and the sink node, which represents the external market environment, including final demand and value added respectively. The links in network denote the sale and purchase relationships between producers and consumers within an economy.

For each input-output table, we can convert it to an open flow network with stander weighted adjacency matrix shown in Figure 1, based on which we can define the flow distance calculated by the equation below, which represents the average step that particles in this random system have jumped from i to j for the first time(also called the first-passage flow distance).

</div>

where the fundamental matrix U are defined as follows:

<img src="http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=\U= I + M + M^2 + M^3 + \cdots + M^ \infty = (I-M)^{-1}" style="border:none;">
</div>

And the IFN is:

## Result
1. Comparison between flow distance and two typical input-output coefficients
Compared with two typical coeiffcients, flow distance captures the information of capital transactions among sectors and structure-based information.

2. Comparison of industrial structure between China and the United States
There are common structure between two countries, while some industries possess totally different ecological niches like CompE.

3. The evolution of Chinese \textit{Real estate activities} industry as a representative example
We find the trajectory of flow distance can match the development of industrial policy change of the real estate industry during the last decades in China.
