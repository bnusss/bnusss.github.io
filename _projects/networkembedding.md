## The Hidden Flow Structure and Metric Space under Random Walk based Network Embedding Algorithms


Network embedding which encodes all vertices in a network as a set of numerical vectors in accordance with the networks’ local and global structures. Recently, several algorithms based on random walks such as deepwalk and node2vec have drawn much attention for their high efficiency and accuracy in node classification however there is still a lack of theoretical explanation, and the transparency of those algorithms has been doubted. Here, we propose FGE algorithm to uncover the underlying flow structure and its hidden metric space of the random walk based embedding algorithms. We show that the essence of embedding is the latent metric structure defined on the open-flow network. This discovery not only deepens our understanding of random walk based embedding algorithms but also helps in finding new potential applications in network embedding.

To build a connection between language and network, a random walk needs to be implemented on the network such that the node sequences generated by random walks are treated as sentences in which nodes resemble words. To reveal the flow structure behind a random walk strategy, we construct an open-flow network model in accordance with the random walk strategies. An open-flow network is a special directed weighted network in which the nodes are identical to those of the original network, and the weighted edges represent the actual fluxes realized by a large number of random walks. Figure 1 illustrates how the different open-flow networks are constructed for a single background binary network with deepwalk in the upper panel and node2vec in the lower panel.The combination of flow distance and the manifold learning method Multi-Dimensional Scaling is named as Flow-based Geometric Embedding (FGE).

1. We notice that the open flow network model can be used to reflect the flow structure behind different random walk strategies. As shown in table 1
2. We discover that there is a high correlation between the flow distance and the euclidean distance calculated by the embedding results of node2vec algorithm for any node pair, therefore, the embedding results of FGE and node2vec are highly correlated compared to other known embedding algorithms. As shown in table 2
3. We infer that there is a hidden metric structure in the embedding vector space, and this metric structure can be used for clustering and ranking nodes. As shown in Figure 2
