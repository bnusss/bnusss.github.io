## Attention：
Attention is a resource - and everyone is limited.（Matthew Crawford）.
      The core resources of the information society are attention, attention is limited and scarce, and the competition for attention has promoted the development of society. The Internet is a place for attention trading. for example，the Internet ecosystem , if a website has more and more users, it gets more and more attention, and it is more important for users, then people will put more attention to improve it. Conversely, if a site has a small user base, it gets less attention and develops more slowly, or diminishing with less attention.Figure 1 is an Internet Attention Ecosystem. Google search engine is at the center of the Internet. The bigger the point, the more attention the site gets.

 Community stickness, a measure of how much attention your site gets, more intuitively, says it calculates the average number of hits per person on that site. Figure 2 shows the daily number of users and the number of user clicks of the psychology course (autonomous mode)  
on Xuetang online.from January to June 2017.)

Figure 3 shows the psychology course stickness index, the slope of the fitted line is stickness.
The psychology course has a slope of 1.09.

## What we are doing with Attention theory:
Predicting community development ，We want to predict the success of a given community；
Calculate the stickiness of the forum for each course and evaluate the quality of the course ；
Taking the course of the introduction of psychology as an example, the attention flow network is established by using nodes of different levels；
Based on the learner's attention flow data, the attention flow network of different course neutron nodes is compared laterally ；
Clustering students to analyze Whether the learning trajectory of learners Curriculum stickiness ,and its structure (network diameter, cluster coefficient) affect the collective attention flow changes;
Mining Course Structures: How does the tree structure affect attention flow?
