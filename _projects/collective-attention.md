# Representation of Online Communities 

## Background

  Community studies have been a major area of research in social science, and one of the most important aspects is how a society develops and evolves over time. Finding a series of indicators that can identify the potential shares of a society, judging whether a society is constantly growing and whether can be able to survive long-term have great practical significance to entire internet sector and social sciences. 

  As a result, a large number of scientists have putted a lot of energy into analyzin the development of the community and build a series of models. Howerver, most of the traditional research focuses on specific networks, especially those that have achieved great success, such as facebook, twitter, flicker and others. Few people pay attention to those communities that have short life time. In addition, it is seldom possible to characterize the development of the entire community from the perspective of a large scale, instead, people often simulate the development of the whole community by individuals behaviour. Recently, Sanjay Kairam et al., Through the perspective of the entire community network structure, hoped to predict the growth and life cycle of a community and achieved good results.
